## Background ##

The 17 wallpaper groups are a part of group theory in mathematics. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group.
It refers to the number of ways to tile a plane infinitely, and is a collection of symmetric groups.
17 is a wacky number (prime), and doesn't show up often (not Fibonacci, and especially not in combinatorics), which is what initially drew my interest. 
Next steps include expanding it to 3 dimensions; with 320 wallpaper groups!

It was also inspired by a game I used to play called http://weavesilk.com/
